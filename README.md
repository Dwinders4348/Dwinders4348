Hi, I’m @Dwinders4348 (Damion Winders).
I’m interested in back-end development, testing, video game design, and general problem-solving, as well as entrepreneurship. 
I’m currently working on data structures and algorithms. After that, I'll be studying software engineering, and then I should be close to graduating with my Bachelor's in Computer Science.  
You can email me at Dwinders4348@gmail.com
